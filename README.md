# Sportscar Hunter
A Car Social Media app using React Native


# Back End
## NGROK
Ngrok is a third party ssh tunneling framework that creates public access to private/localhost ports. This will only be necessary on the backend, so if you are working on the front-end, dont install it.

To install ngrok, please use: https://ngrok.com/.

## Flask
Flask is probably our best way to expose a port for ngrok to use, so server should run via that


# Front End
## React
React is our front-end library. If you are solely working on the server, do not install it! It is really simple and easy to use, just follow the installation found here: https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html

# Next steps
With the necessary packages installed, try running the project! Make sure all changes are committed to GitHub first!. Then, just navigate to the website on your phone! The link can be found here: (link needs to be created first)
